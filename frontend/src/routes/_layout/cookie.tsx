              Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
              They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the owners of the site. 
              When you access a website, cookies allow that site to recognize your device, saving you from having to log in repeatedly, 
              remembering language preferences, and offering other features to enhance your browsing experience.

              Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar 
              technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). 
              These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has 
              visited our Website or opened an email we sent them. Web beacons are used to improve website functionality and 
              gain insights into user behavior, ensuring that we continue to refine and adapt our content to meet the needs
